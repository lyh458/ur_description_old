This package is clone from [universal_robot, ur_description](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/kinetic-devel/ur_description), which is an older version rather than [fmauch's version](https://github.com/fmauch/universal_robot/tree/kinetic-devel/ur_description).

Since some old packages are based on the older version, but maybe you are using the newer and don't want to downgrade. So you can git clone this package or download from the source repo.

BTW, the package is rename as **ur_description_old** for advoiding same name error with the newer version.
